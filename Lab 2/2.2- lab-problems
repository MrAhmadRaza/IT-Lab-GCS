-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1: In this programme, we will analyze the size of basic data types.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() 
{
    cout << "\n\n Find Size of fundamental data types :\n";
	  cout << "------------------------------------------\n";
    cout << " The sizeof(char) is :          " << sizeof(char) << " bytes \n" ;
    cout << " The sizeof(short) is :         " << sizeof(short) << " bytes \n" ;
    cout << " The sizeof(int) is :           " << sizeof(int) << " bytes \n" ;
    cout << " The sizeof(long) is :          " << sizeof(long) << " bytes \n" ;
    cout << " The sizeof(long long) is :     " << sizeof(long long) << " bytes \n";
    cout << " The sizeof(float) is :         " << sizeof(float) << " bytes \n" ;
    cout << " The sizeof(double) is :        " << sizeof(double) << " bytes \n";
    cout << " The sizeof(long double) is :   " << sizeof(long double) << " bytes \n";
    cout << " The sizeof(bool) is :          " << sizeof(bool) << " bytes \n\n";
    return 0;
}

// The size of data type represtents, how large number a type can hold.
// We use these different types according to our requirements, It depends
// on the the number we are working with. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2: A simple program to understand the data types and there respective values.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() 
{
   char gender = 'F';             // char is single-quoted
   bool isEmployed = true;         // true(non-zero) or false(0)
   unsigned short numOfsons = 2; // [0, 255]
   short yearOfAppt = 2009;      // [-32767, 32768]
   unsigned int YearlyPackage = 1500000;   // [0, 4294967295]
   double height = 79.48;       // With fractional part
   float gpa = 4.69f;           // Need suffix 'f' for float
   long totalDrawan = 12047235L;     // Suffix 'L' for long
   long long balance = 995324987LL;  // Need suffix 'LL' for long long int  

   cout << " The Gender is : " << gender << endl;
   cout << " Is she married? : " << isEmployed << endl;
   cout << " Number of sons she has : " << numOfsons << endl;
   cout << " Year of her appointment : " << yearOfAppt << endl;
   cout << " Salary for a year : " << YearlyPackage << endl;
   cout << " Height is : " << height << endl;
   cout << " GPA is " << gpa << endl;
   cout << " Salary drawn upto : " << totalDrawan << endl;
   cout << " Balance till : " << balance << endl;   
   return 0;
}

// ** Remember, this is a good practice to use data type according to the range of values of variable 
// you want to work with. Always avoid to hold extra memory which is not needed. 
// For example, if you want to store 'age' of a person: Normally a person's age could be [0-100]. 
//      So 'unsigned short' is best type to store age.
