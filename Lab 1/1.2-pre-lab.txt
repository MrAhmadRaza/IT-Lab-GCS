We will cover some basic terms of a C++ program in this session, which would help us in coming problems:

-------------------------
Structure of C++ program
-------------------------
#include<iostream>;

using namespace std;

void main()
{
    //Program Body
}
*Most of the C++ Programs start with #include <iostream>
    -iostream: is a header file which contains certain built in functions. Mostly used for cout, cin and cerr. In all the above             mentioned functions c stands for console. So cout is console output, cin is console input.

    -Header Files: in C++ Header files contain definitions of Functions and Variables, which is imported or used into any C++ program by        using the pre-processor #include statement.

    -pre-processor: programs provides preprocessors directives/instruction which tell the compiler to preprocess the source code before       compiling. All of these preprocessor directive begins with a '#' (hash) symbol.

*using namespace std;
    -a namespace is designed to overcome the difficulty in having same name and is used as additional information to differentiate            similar functions, variables etc. eg. std::cout<<""; and int cout = 5;
*main()
    -Every C++ program starts with main(), which is called the main function, entry point of program.

* //
    -The // character is used at the beginning of a single line comment.
-----------------------------
Escape characters in a string
-----------------------------
\n: new line
\t: tab
\a: alarm/beep
\r: return the cursor to the first character in the same line.
