Homework Problem 3.1
---------------------
Write a program in C++ to find the perfect numbers between 1 and 500.
Remember, a number is perfect if sum of its divisors is equal to number. 
e.g sum of divisors of 6 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. So 6 is perfect number.
 - Which looping structure is best for this problem  ?
 Simple Algorithm:
    - iterate from 1 to 500. 
      -calculate sum of divisors of each number
      -if sum is same as number then number is perfect number.
      
 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 int main()
 {
    for (int i = 1 to 500) // write condition
    {
       while() // loop to find divisors 
       {
          // statements to find compute sum of divisors
       }
       // statements to print perfect number if sum of divisors is equal to number
    }
   return 0;
   
 }
----------------------
Homework Problem 3.2
----------------------
// Find the factorial of a number 
// Again we do not know the number of iterations at compile time. So best case is while loop
// Note: factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5.
Simple Algorithm:
  -start
  -Input a number to find factorial
  -iterate from 1 to number 
    -multiply the loop numbers to find factorial
  -end
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int num,factorial=1, counter=0;
    cout << " Input a number to find the factorial: ";
    cin>> num;
    // your set of statements to find factorial.
    cout<<" The factorial of the given number is: "<<factorial<<endl;
    return 0;
 }
